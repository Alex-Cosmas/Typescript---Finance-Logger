# Typescript---Finance-Logger
Spent the weekend trying to understand Typescript deeper by building a Finance Logger application.
I focused more on functionality and understanding of the key concepts such as: 

* Type Casting 
* Classes
* Use of Public, Private, Read Only types 
* Modules
* Interfaces
* Interface with classes
* Generics 
* Enums
* Tuples
